# API Client

Communication with the backend API is implemented through the client in `ApiClient.ts`. It's an autogenerated file that contains all required methods and types for work with API. 

Auto-generation is done through the package NSwag which uses open API documentation to generate typescript client code. NSwag is listed as a dev dependency in this project. 

`nswag.json` contains required configuration.

## Regeneration

After any changes in the contract on API (new endpoints, URL changes, requests, or return types) ApiClinet needs to be regenerated to reflect all changes. 

1. Start the API on your local machine *
1. Ensure url `/swagger` is working properly 
1. Run command: `node_modules/.bin/nswag run`
1. Check changes in `ApiClinet.ts`
1. Fix all broken code dependencies on ApiClient

\* *you can specify exact location in nswag.json*
